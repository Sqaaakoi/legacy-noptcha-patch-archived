# TL;DR of below

## This is (probably) dead.

This repository is now archived due to GPU Drops making their service and official extension less sketchy, and a paid subscription with a free daily quota. Use a VPN to bypass that quota.

# Long version

GPU Drops have unfortunately decided that captcha solving is profitable, just as much as selling a captcha service.

The service has been converted to a subscription model, with a free 50 captchas per day per IP address limit.

I currently cannot see any way to bypass this. I'd also like to quickly note that the servers can and do IP ban for trying to screw around with subscription license keys. Please migrate back to the source extension as I feel it is safe to use without any affiliate link injection.

While writing this, I have noticed the original extension is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NopeCHA/NopeCHA). If you want to continue using the extension, go to that repository instead or visit [nopecha.com](https://nopecha.com/) for more information on their paid subscriptions (I doubt people from this repository will buy such subscriptions though).

**I'd suggest just using a VPN to bypass the daily limit - you're probably going to need a VPN for using (abusing??) the services that have CAPTCHAs on them anyway as you're probably needing this to make a lot of accounts or something.**
